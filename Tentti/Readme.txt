Our final assigment was to create rest api from imaginary online store.

It had the following requirements:

- The store must have atleast 10 products.
- Prices of three products must be as follows: 18.90, 40.90, 99.90
- There must be atleast three and each must contain atleast 2 products.
- Product picture can be any url from web with appropriate picture.

- Instead of a database the product data can be stored in PHP -object or JSON file.
- Interface layer must return JSON -formatted data. 
- Interface layer must accept parameters.

- Interface layer must have functionality for/accept category -parameter.
- Interface layer must have functionality for/accept Id -parameter.
- Interface layer must have functionality for/accept price that is smaller than x -parameter.  
- Interface layer must have functionality for/accept no parameter, when all products will be listed.

- Test tool for ease of testing (In this case index.php).

Please note!
The product picture urls were online at the time of this assigment, but will more than likely be deprecated after some time passes.
